# Vocabulary Review

##### Description
* Being able to "speak" programmer is a very important skill. 
* Being at a bootcamp school let's you get more practice with this skill than someone who is alone in their home learning to program.
* Try to define the words below. Also, try to talk about them with a friend in your class. Using them in your speech will help you learn them better!
* BONUS: Print up your definitions so that we can hang them around the room! Ask Jeff if you need hep with the printer!

##### Objective 
* Give me your ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5) Definitions!
* (hint: many are defined in the Gordon's wiki!)
* the Python for Kids book also has a good glossary.
